- Fixed some cases of nested strong and em in the Standard dialect's
  parser. It was broken for cases like this:

  *This **is a test***.

  This should turn into HTML like

  <em>This <strong>is a test</strong></em>

  but instead turned into

  <em>This</em> <em>is a test</em>*.

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world. Still rather alpha, and
  internals are subject to lots of change.
